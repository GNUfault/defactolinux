Subject: [PATCH v5] CONTRIBUTING.d/ai: Add guidelines banning AI for
 contributing
To: <linux-man@vger.kernel.org>

This policy is based on the Gentoo policy (see link below).
However, I've modified our text to be more restrictive.

+Name
+	AI - artificial intelligence policy
+
+Description
+	It is expressly forbidden to contribute to this project any
+	content that has been created with the assistance of AI tools.
+
+	This also includes AI assistive tools used in the contributing
+	process, even if such tools do not generate the contributed
+	code.
+
+    Exceptions
+	As an exception to the above, AI assistive tools on which the
+	contributor depends for health reasons, and which don't have
+	a major influence on the contribution, are allowed, and the
+	contributor does not need to disclose their use.
+
+    Concerns
+	Copyright concerns.
+		At this point, the regulations concerning copyright of
+		generated contents are still emerging worldwide.  Using
+		such material could pose a danger of copyright
+		violations, but it could also weaken claims to copyright
+		and void the guarantees given by copyleft licensing.
+
+	Quality concerns.
+		Popular LLMs are really great at generating plausibly
+		looking, but meaningless content.  They pose both the
+		risk of lowering the quality of a project, and of
+		requiring an unfair human effort from contributors and
+		maintainers to review contributions and detect the
+		mistakes resulting from the use of AI.
+
+		AI tools should be considered adversarial, as if they
+		were a black box with Jia Tan inside them.
+
+	Ethical concerns.
+		The business side of AI boom is creating serious ethical
+		concerns.  Among them:
+
+		-  Commercial AI projects are frequently indulging in
+		   blatant copyright violations to train their models.
+		-  Their operations are causing concerns about the huge
+		   use of energy, water, and other natural resources.
+		-  The advertising and use of AI models has caused
+		   a significant harm to employees and reduction of
+		   service quality.
+		-  LLMs have been empowering all kinds of spam and scam
+		   efforts.
+
+Caveats
+	This policy can be revisited, should a case been made over such
+	a tool that does not pose copyright, ethical, and quality
+	concerns.
+
+Copyright
+	Text derived from (and more restrictive than) the Gentoo project
+	AI policy
